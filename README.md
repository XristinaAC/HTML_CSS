# HTML_CSS

Both projects were created while taking the courses from linkedin:
  -"CSS Essential Training" - portofolio project
  -"Semantic HTML and CSS Code Challenges" - robot eshop
  
  
For the "portofolio page", the html code was provided. I just added the css style. 
For the "robot eshop" I wrote both the html and css style. All the images were provided from the course. 

Both webpages are created to be rensponsive for desktops, phones and tablets.
